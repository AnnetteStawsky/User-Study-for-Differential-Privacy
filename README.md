# User-Study-for-Differential-Privacy

Differential Privacy is implemented by companies without user input. This study
aims at quantifying which values of epsilon are effective from a user perspective.
We conduct a user study where we process participant data using a specific epsilon
and local differential privacy. We then analyzed the users’ answers for whether
they felt that their privacy was preserved. We also measure the utility of using
different epsilons, and identify an epsilon range that balances privacy and utility.
We found that minimum utility (50 percent accuracy or greater) was achieved
between epsilons 2.02 and 5.49. There were similar comfort levels for these two
epsilons regarding the user’s biggest fear, but there was a slightly greater comfort
level for 2.02 when dealing with more sensitive information. Since most cases
where differential privacy is used in practice deal with very sensitive information,
our study shows that users would be comfortable with an epsilon around 2.02.
